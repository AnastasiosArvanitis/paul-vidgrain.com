A web site that I have created for Paul Vidgrain, a French artist.


This is my first attempt to create a web site in php and mySQL. Of course it's not perfect but I have created to learn so I am still working on it and trying to avance it's functionalities. I have also created an ajax call in the guest book with jQuery and php. The javaScript library that I have used in jQuery, and I am glad for that beacause it has led me to try React after that :) Feel free to let me your comments!
